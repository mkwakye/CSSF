            The Caribbean Students Scholarship Fund, Inc. was officially launched in 2004 
            by the Trinidad and Tobago Working Women´s Committee, with the understanding 
            that it is more important to give than to receive and bearing in mind that 
            our youth is the future of the world. <br><br>

            The Caribbean Students Scholarship Fund, Inc. provides an opportunity to 
            invest in the education of our community´s youths. Simultaneously, the 
            CSSF, Inc. will establish and maintain a fellowship rooted in traditional 
            and historical Caribbean principles-- of using one´s skills in service to 
            the community and put into practice those principles that build upon the 
            strong history of the Caribbean. <br><br>

            The Fund offers scholarship assistance to students of Caribbean descent 
            who reside in the Washington metropolitan area (Maryland, Virginia and 
            the District of Columbia). The Scholarships are offered to students who 
            are high school seniors and full-time undergraduate and graduate students. <br><br>

            Funding comes from a variety of sources. The majority of our funds are 
            raised by activities hosted by the Working Women´s Committee. In addition, 
            contributions and donations are made by individuals and businesses. 
            CSSF, Inc. is a 501 (c) 3 tax exempt organization. 
            (CSSF, Inc. does not solicit on-line donations). <br><br>
